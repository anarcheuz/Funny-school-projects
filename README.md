=====================

4if-prolog
===========
Is an implementation of the dots and boxes game entirely in Prolog language which is based on logic programming as opposed to functionnal. 
The Map can be generated as user wishes.
Random and Greedy algorithm have been implemented as AI.

WebSemantic
============
We've created a new search engine, based on Google search engine results. These results are enriched with a semantic (RDF graphs, SPARQL).
Then we've created a new ranking order based on the Jaccard index with a real time variable acceptability threshold.

DevOO
===========
We have implemented a delevery system with a dynamic GUI in javascript for user interface and java to compute shortest routes using choco solver.
It is MVC conformed. 

Os-Raspberry
============
This is an initiation into programming Kernels. We have designed various schedulers, some syscalls and virtual memory virtualization (printing and reading are probably there too). There are still a lot of work to be done but we are quite proud of this small school project.
